# ethereum_DApps
Sample projects for building Blockchain apps or integrating cryptocurrency on existing apps on Ethereum

This project contains example code for developing blockchain apps or incorporating cryptocurrency into existing apps. It demonstrates how to operate in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem for mobile and web developers who are familiar with programming principles. The project entails developing a smart contract, a web user interface, and JavaScript that connects the two. It will assist developers in becoming more familiar with the essential programming ideas and methods associated with Ethereum development.

Learn about the Ethereum blockchain and how it varies from the bitcoin blockchain. Learn about Solidity, the programming language used on the Ethereum network to create smart contracts. In addition, you'll learn how to create decentralized apps (DApps) using web programming languages you already know.

**Objectives for learning:**
- What is the difference between the Ethereum blockchain and bitcoin? 
- What are smart contracts and how do they work?
- In Solidity, creating a smart contract from the ground up.
- Truffle is being used to test smart contracts.
- Interacting with the blockchain using web3.js
- Swarm resource deployment
